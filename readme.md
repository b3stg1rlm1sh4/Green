## What is Green?
Green is about as simple as point and click gets. Before you is a 3 by 3 grid, 8 boxes red and 1 green. Your objective is to click the green box. Hence the name green.
## Where to play it?
The game should operate fine within any browser(as of 29/08/2021), simply `clone` the repo and utilise vscode's live server extension. Alternatively, (provided [repl.it](https://replit.com) doesn't cease to exist) the game may be played [here](https://Green.b3stg1rlm1sh4.repl.co)
